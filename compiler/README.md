# Hasky Compiler

Hasky Compiler helps you transform high-level Hasky source code into
machine-level instructions.

## Usage

```bash
hasky help                  # Print a brief help message.
hasky version               # Display current Hasky Compiler version.
hasky compile SOURCE.ha     # Compile one Hasky file (mostly used for debug).
hasky build                 # Build the whole project from `src` and `lib`.
```
